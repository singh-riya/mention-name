Mention Input Component:

Tech stack: React + Typescript Link to design

If I had more time, here are some additional improvements I would consider:
1.  Fetch mention suggestions dynamically from an API based on user input.
2.   Improve the styling of the component to match the design provided.
3.   Write unit tests for the component to ensure its functionality.
4.   Ensure the component is accessible by adding appropriate ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
5.   Allow customization of the mention format and appearance.
